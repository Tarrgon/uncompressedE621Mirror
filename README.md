# Uncompressed E621 Mirror
This is a tool for furry artists to have hi-res versions of their art be mirrored to e621 rather than going through multiple compression hoops when uploading to certain sites.

# Obtaining a key
Due to the nature of this project, you must obtain an access key before using. This key can be obtained by adding `trikzz__` on discord and sending me a message.

## Setting your key
Right click on the extension and click "Options" then paste your key in the only available text box and click the button.

Intentional abuse of the system will have your key permanently revoked and access to the service terminated.

# How does it work?
When uploading images to (currently) furaffinity, or twitter (x), if enabled, the extension will grab the images you are sending and send a copy of them, uncompressed, directly to a webserver that stores them temporarily to be uploaded to e621 after they are tagged.

### Who tags them?
Anyone can tag the images by going to https://yiff.today/visualtagger and using the search query `uncompressedupload`. Though usually this will be handled by myself, `trikzz__` (`DefinitelyNotAFurry4` on e6).
